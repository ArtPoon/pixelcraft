pixelcraft
==========

JavaScript code for converting video game sprite PNGs or GIFs into cross-stitch patterns or a craft of your choice.
This web application features an interactive slider for reducing the number of colours (while updating the image in real time).
In addition, it maps the RGB colours to a craft of your choice, including embroidery floss for cross-stitching (DMC and Anchor), Lego, Crayola, and Perler or Hama beads.
Patterns can be exported as PDFs for saving and printing.
