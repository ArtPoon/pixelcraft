pixelcraft
==========

A web app for converting video game sprite PNGs or GIFs into cross-stitch patterns or a craft of your choice.
**pixelcraft** features an interactive slider for reducing the number of colours (while updating the image in real time).
In addition, it maps the RGB colours to a craft of your choice, including embroidery floss for cross-stitching (DMC and Anchor), Lego, Crayola, and Perler or Hama beads.
Patterns can be exported as PDFs for saving and printing.
